    "# Introduction to Prompt Engineering\n",
    "Prompt engineering is the process of designing and optimizing prompts for natural language processing tasks. It involves selecting the right prompts, tuning their parameters, and evaluating their performance. Prompt engineering is crucial for achieving high accuracy and efficiency in NLP models. In this section, we will explore the basics of prompt engineering using the OpenAI models for exploration."

      "5. Use a template for the response: Instead of returning a string directly in the \"hello\" function, you can use a template to generate the response. This can make your code more organized and easier to read.\n",

      "6. Add type hints: Adding type hints to your code can help improve readability and make it easier to understand the types of variables being used in your functions. You can add type hints to function arguments and return types.\n",

      "8. Add unit tests: Writing unit tests for your code can help ensure that it works as expected and can help catch any potential bugs or issues. You can use a testing framework like pytest to write and run unit tests for your code.\n"
